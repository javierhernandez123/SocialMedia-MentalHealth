## **Three Categorical Variables – Frequency Tables**

We treat the following three columns as categorical:

1.  **social_media_platforms_used** – number of platforms a respondent uses

2.  **stress_level** – self-reported stress (0–10)

3.  **mood_score** – self-reported mood (0–10)

``` r
freq_tbl <- function(df, var) {
  df %>% 
    count({{ var }}) %>% 
    mutate(percent = round(100 * n / sum(n), 1))
}

freq_platforms <- freq_tbl(habits, social_media_platforms_used)
freq_stress    <- freq_tbl(habits, stress_level)
freq_mood      <- freq_tbl(habits, mood_score)
```

### **Table 1: Social-Media Platforms Used**

``` r
kable(freq_platforms,
      col.names = c("Platforms", "Count", "Percent"),
      caption = "Distribution of the number of social-media platforms used.") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

### **Table 2: Stress Level**

``` r
kable(freq_stress,
      col.names = c("Stress Level", "Count", "Percent"),
      caption = "Self-reported stress level (0 = no stress, 10 = extreme stress).") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

### **Table 3: Mood Score**

``` r
kable(freq_mood,
      col.names = c("Mood Score", "Count", "Percent"),
      caption = "Self-reported mood score (0 = very negative, 10 = very positive).") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

## **Quick Interpretation**

-   **Platforms**: The modal category is **5 platforms** (≈ 30 % of respondents); very few people use only one.

-   **Stress**: Answers cluster between **3–6**, but a pronounced spike at **10** reveals a small, highly-stressed group.

-   **Mood**: The distribution is **heavily left-skewed**; more than half the sample chose the maximum score of **10**, suggesting that—on average—participants feel quite positive despite varying stress levels.
